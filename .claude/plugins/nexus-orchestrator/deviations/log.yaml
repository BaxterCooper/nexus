# Nexus Orchestrator - Deviation Log
#
# This file tracks deviations from expected subagent behavior.
# Each deviation is analyzed and used to refine prompts.
#
# Schema:
#   id: auto-increment integer
#   timestamp: ISO 8601 UTC
#   expected: what should have happened
#   actual: what did happen
#   root_cause: misinterpretation | schema_violation | unsupported_claim | blocked | low_confidence
#   fix: exact change to prevent recurrence
#
# Entries are appended automatically by the verify-output hook.
# Review periodically to improve the executor prompt.
